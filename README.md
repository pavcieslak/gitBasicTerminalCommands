#gitIntroduction

Open index.html for a list of basic GIT commands.

This file is still in development and will get updated and modified.

The idea behind it is to share a list of common GitHub commands
with people who can't memorize it, I certainly can't at this stage
of my development, but thanks to such list, I'ts much easier whilst
using it as reference.

Hope it will be usefull for you as it is for me.
